/**
 * This package's main export is {@link Context}. Get the current Activity's context with
 * {@link Context.current | `Context.current()`}:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';
 *
 * export async function myActivity() {
 *   const context = Context.current();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Any function can be used as an Activity as long as its parameters and return value are serializable using a
 * {@link https://docs.temporal.io/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter/ | DataConverter}.
 *
 * ### Cancellation
 *
 * Activity Cancellation:
 *
 * - lets the Activity know it doesn't need to keep doing work, and
 * - gives the Activity time to clean up any resources it has created.
 *
 * Activities can only receive Cancellation if they {@link Context.heartbeat | emit heartbeats} or are Local Activities
 * (which can't heartbeat but receive Cancellation anyway).
 *
 * An Activity may receive Cancellation if:
 *
 * - The Workflow scope containing the Activity call was requested to be Cancelled and
 *   {@link ActivityOptions.cancellationType} was **not** set to {@link ActivityCancellationType.ABANDON}. The scope can
 *   be cancelled in either of the following ways:
 *   - The entire Workflow was Cancelled (via {@link WorkflowHandle.cancel}).
 *   - Calling {@link CancellationScope.cancel}) from inside a Workflow.
 * - The Worker has started to shut down. Shutdown is initiated by either:
 *   - One of the {@link RuntimeOptions.shutdownSignals} was sent to the process.
 *   - {@link Worker.shutdown | `Worker.shutdown()`} was called.
 * - The Activity was considered failed by the Server because any of the Activity timeouts have triggered (for example,
 *   the Server didn't receive a heartbeat within the {@link ActivityOptions.heartbeatTimeout}). The
 *   {@link CancelledFailure} will have `message: 'TIMED_OUT'`.
 * - An Activity sends a heartbeat with `Context.current().heartbeat()` and the heartbeat details can't be converted by
 *   the Worker's configured {@link DataConverter}.
 * - The Workflow Run reached a {@link https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#status | Closed state}, in which case the
 *   {@link CancelledFailure} will have `message: 'NOT_FOUND'`.
 *
 * The reason for the Cancellation is available at {@link CancelledFailure.message} or
 * {@link Context#cancellationSignal | Context.cancellationSignal.reason}.
 *
 * Activity implementations should opt-in and subscribe to cancellation using one of the following methods:
 *
 * 1. `await` on {@link Context.cancelled | `Context.current().cancelled`} or
 *    {@link Context.sleep | `Context.current().sleep()`}, which each throw a {@link CancelledFailure}.
 * 2. Pass the context's {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal | `AbortSignal`} at
 *    {@link Context.cancellationSignal | `Context.current().cancellationSignal`} to a library that supports it.
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * #### An Activity that sends progress heartbeats and can be Cancelled
 *
 * <!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-fake-progress-->
 * <!--SNIPEND-->
 *
 * #### An Activity that makes a cancellable HTTP request
 *
 * It passes the `AbortSignal` to {@link https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#api | `fetch`}: `fetch(url, { signal:
 * Context.current().cancellationSignal })`.
