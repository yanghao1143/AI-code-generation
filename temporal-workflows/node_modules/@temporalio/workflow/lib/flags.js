     * This flag gates multiple fixes related to cancellation scopes and timers introduced in 1.10.2/1.11.0:
     * - Cancellation of a non-cancellable scope no longer propagates to children scopes
     *   (see https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1423).
     * - CancellationScope.withTimeout(fn) now cancel the timer if `fn` completes before expiration
     *   of the timeout, similar to how `condition(fn, timeout)` works.
     * - Timers created using setTimeout can now be intercepted.
     *
     * @since Introduced in 1.10.2/1.11.0. However, due to an SDK bug, SDKs v1.11.0 and v1.11.1 were not
     *        properly writing back the flags to history, possibly resulting in NDE on replay. We therefore
     *        consider that a WFT emitted by Worker v1.11.0 or v1.11.1 to implicitly have this flag on.

     * Prior to 1.11.0, when processing a Workflow activation, the SDK would execute `notifyHasPatch`
     * and `signalWorkflow` jobs in distinct phases, before other types of jobs. The primary reason
     * behind that multi-phase algorithm was to avoid the possibility that a Workflow execution might
     * complete before all incoming signals have been dispatched (at least to the point that the
     * _synchronous_ part of the handler function has been executed).
     *
     * This flag replaces that multi-phase algorithm with a simpler one where jobs are simply sorted as
     * `(signals and updates) -> others`, but without processing them as distinct batches (i.e. without
     * leaving/reentering the VM context between each group, which automatically triggers the execution
     * of all outstanding microtasks). That single-phase approach resolves a number of quirks of the
     * former algorithm, and yet still satisfies to the original requirement of ensuring that every
     * `signalWorkflow` jobs - and now `doUpdate` jobs as well - have been given a proper chance to
     * execute before the Workflow main function might completes.
     *
     * @since Introduced in 1.11.0. This change is not rollback-safe. However, due to an SDK bug, SDKs
     *        v1.11.0 and v1.11.1 were not properly writing back the flags to history, possibly resulting
     *        in NDE on replay. We therefore consider that a WFT emitted by Worker v1.11.0 or v1.11.1
     *        to implicitely have this flag on.
