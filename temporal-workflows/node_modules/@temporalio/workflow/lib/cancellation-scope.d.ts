/**
 * Cancellation Scopes provide the mechanic by which a Workflow may gracefully handle incoming requests for cancellation
 * (e.g. in response to {@link WorkflowHandle.cancel} or through the UI or CLI), as well as request cancelation of
 * cancellable operations it owns (e.g. Activities, Timers, Child Workflows, etc).
 *
 * Cancellation Scopes form a tree, with the Workflow's main function running in the root scope of that tree.
 * By default, cancellation propagates down from a parent scope to its children and its cancellable operations.
 * A non-cancellable scope can receive cancellation requests, but is never effectively considered as cancelled,
 * thus shieldding its children and cancellable operations from propagation of cancellation requests it receives.
 *
 * Scopes are created using the `CancellationScope` constructor or the static helper methods {@link cancellable},
 * {@link nonCancellable} and {@link withTimeout}. `withTimeout` creates a scope that automatically cancels itself after
 * some duration.
 *
 * Cancellation of a cancellable scope results in all operations created directly in that scope to throw a
 * {@link CancelledFailure} (either directly, or as the `cause` of an {@link ActivityFailure} or a
 * {@link ChildWorkflowFailure}). Further attempt to create new cancellable scopes or cancellable operations within a
 * scope that has already been cancelled will also immediately throw a {@link CancelledFailure} exception. It is however
 * possible to create a non-cancellable scope at that point; this is often used to execute rollback or cleanup
 * operations. For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * async function myWorkflow(...): Promise<void> {
 *   try {
 *     // This activity runs in the root cancellation scope. Therefore, a cancelation request on
 *     // the Workflow execution (e.g. through the UI or CLI) automatically propagates to this
 *     // activity. Assuming that the activity properly handle the cancellation request, then the
 *     // call below will throw an `ActivityFailure` exception, with `cause` sets to an
 *     // instance of `CancelledFailure`.
 *     await someActivity();
 *   } catch (e) {
 *     if (isCancellation(e)) {
 *       // Run cleanup activity in a non-cancellable scope
 *       await CancellationScope.nonCancellable(async () => {
 *         await cleanupActivity();
 *       }
 *     } else {
 *       throw e;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A cancellable scope may be programatically cancelled by calling {@link cancel|`scope.cancel()`}`. This may be used,
 * for example, to explicitly request cancellation of an Activity or Child Workflow:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const cancellableActivityScope = new CancellationScope();
 * const activityPromise = cancellableActivityScope.run(() => someActivity());
 * cancellableActivityScope.cancel(); // Cancels the activity
 * await activityPromise; // Throws `ActivityFailure` with `cause` set to `CancelledFailure`
 * ```
